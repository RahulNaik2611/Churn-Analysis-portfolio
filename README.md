# ETL Process with Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI

## Project Overview

This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Microsoft SQL Server to manage and prepare data for analysis and visualization in Power BI. The primary goal of this project is to ensure data quality and facilitate effective data exploration, modeling, and visualization.

## Technologies Used

- Microsoft SQL Server
- Power BI
- SQL (Structured Query Language)


## ETL Process

The ETL process consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: Data is extracted from various sources and loaded into staging tables in SQL Server.
2. **Data Transformation**: The data is transformed through various operations to ensure it is clean and ready for analysis.
3. **Data Loading**: The cleaned and transformed data is loaded into production tables for reporting and analysis.

## Data Exploration

During the ETL process, data exploration is performed to understand the dataset better. This includes:

- **Check Distinct Values**: Analyzing the distinct values in key columns to understand the data distribution.
- **Check Nulls**: Identifying columns with null values to assess data quality.

## Data Cleaning

- **Remove Nulls**: Null values are handled by either removing them or replacing them with appropriate default values.
- **Insert New Data**: After cleaning, the new data is inserted into the production tables to ensure that the dataset is up-to-date and accurate.

## Creating Views for Power BI

To facilitate data visualization in Power BI, views are created in SQL Server. These views simplify complex queries and provide a clean interface for Power BI to access the data.

## Data Visualization and Modeling

Using Power BI, data is visualized to provide insights and support decision-making. The following steps are involved:

- **Data Modeling**: Relationships between different tables are established to create a coherent data model.
- **Data Visualization**: Various charts and dashboards are created to represent the data visually, making it easier to interpret and analyze.

- # Churn Analysis Dashboard



The Churn Analysis Dashboard provides insights into customer retention and churn rates. This dashboard is designed to help businesses understand the factors contributing to customer churn and to identify opportunities for improving customer retention strategies.

## Features

- **Churn Rate Visualization**: Displays the overall churn rate over time.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzes churn by different customer segments (e.g., age, location, subscription type).
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizes machine learning models to predict potential churn based on historical data.
- **Key Metrics**: Provides key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention, such as average tenure, customer lifetime value (CLV), and more.
